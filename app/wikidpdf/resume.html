    <p>I have a lot of respect for the Developers at Big Nerd Ranch as well as the company as a whole.  Although I knew how to code well and how to build a system myself, I still hadn't seen how the masters of the craft would handle those dificault problems, so I went to Big Nerd Ranch.  Here I've gotton to work with some of the best programmers I've ever known and get involved in big and well maintained projects.  This experience has been able to fill in the gaps.  I'm much more confident working with large, complex systems

    <!-- 
    I learned to work with TDD and good refactoring habits to find and extract objects into common patterns.  

    I learned to leverage TDD and test mocks to keep dependancies in check.

    I grew in good patterns to interact with other webservices

        <p>Bookie is my initial project at Big Nerd Ranch.  It's an in-house tool that keeps track of meeting rooms, and allows impromptu meetings to be scheduled.  Through a devise on the wall.  I integrated with Google Calendar to store the meeting data (this was already the tool used for meetings around the office).  The tool sets up and responeds to push notifications about meeting changes, and sends push notifications out to all devices that are currently signed up.

    <p>I was the lead developer on three three Rails projects, two of which have an Ember front end.  While working there I grew considerably as a programmer, as I had to learn about an implement many technologies to solve real world problems.  I grew to rely on the use of basic language constructs (POROs and POJOs) to build systems from the ground up.</p>

        <p>This is an in-house tool for GE, used to interact with potential clients and undestand their needs reguarding specific online services.  I created a system forms where all of the fields are interrelated and calculations are made and updated throughout the system imediately, to how the client's decisions can affect their interests.  The system also includes D3 graphs that are updated when any relevant value changes.  Ember.js was a great tool for this job due to it's data bindings and ember data library</p>

          Flywheel is an in-house tool for Look-Listen that brings in data from 6 different APIs with various protocols (including SOAP).  It molds the data into a consistent format and compiles it into a series of reports.  The system gets run once a day providing reports for the previous day.

    <p>I was a part of a team of 3 Rails devs building and maintaining 3 Rails apps.  Our main product was an online library used to find 3D models for Revit.  This position introduced me to a large, complex system with multiple apps operating in concort.
