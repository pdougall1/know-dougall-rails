# Who would I be without you


Sense I started looking into programming the people at BNR have been a beakon of hope.  Through initially going to meetups and fighting through the beginnings of `$ rails new` people at BNR have been willing to talk me through what is happening and give me feedback on my code.  They've been pilars of the community, consistently engaging with consideration to help someone who needs it, always with thier ego in check and an honest desire to help.  I've been 

Just by being kind they showed me I had a place in this industry, and that I can make it happen if I put in some effort.  

They've shown me how to respect other programmers and the work they do.

That a good developer is available to other developers who need them.  Often it is hard to take the time to review another person's code, but everyone at BNR has been willing to when I've asked, and each time they've given me something valueable that I can take with me. 

I've known that eventually this internship would come to an end, and that I better get as much as I can out of it while it's here.  I believe that they gave me the push I needed to really make my way as a programmer.  I'll try to enumerate:

  - An example of what a seasoned senior developer is like, and how they engage with their work.

  - An understanding of basic principles, and importantly, how to recognize when to apply these principles.  

  - A great appreciation for the benefits of testing, specifically towards dependancy management, code exploration, and security in refactoring

### Bookie (my intern project)







### This is a craft

This work is definitely a craft.  It's very creative work.  There are always a huge variety of ways to accomplish a goal in code. And, maybe unfortunately, many of them are the right way.  I grew up oil painting.  I was very bad at it at first.  I could slap paint on a canvas, and it might resemple a bowl of fruit, but it was not very pleasing to look at (though my mother always told me it was :)  This was not good painting.

Eventually I learned to weild the brush.  I could use it to provide many different effects and with a greater degree of precision.  The paintings started looking more and more like the thing I was painting.  I was still far from being an artist, but I was learning the tools of my craft.  I still had to learn color theory, which is great knowledge but useless if you can't apply it to an acutal painting.  So I had to practice, experiment with different applications to experience real problems as they present themselves.  I tried to go back to theory books to give me solutions, but all they give me is the general guide.  I still had to mix the colors and determine how to apply them to the painting.  Where do these different theories apply?  Who's wisdom is relevant here?

Painting is also multi-dimentional, especially with oils.  The paint stays wet so it's still maleable days after it's applied.  Sometimes a base coat is importnat to set the context for the next day's work.  You can be thinking of how the whites in this base layer will dullen the more translucent color you intend to use to create a particular gradient affect when you "scumble" it on in some particular way.  I actually liked this as a tool, and I used it a lot.  It provides a unique effect that I liked and it made my art somewhat unique.  I was learning some identity as a craftsman.  "This is what I like, and how I like to work."  However, the technique didn't determine the worth of the painting.  I wasn't a great painter because I was discovering a technique.  The technique followed from a lot of practice, learning the theory, and trying to apply that theory along the way as I worked.  

It's very hard to pay attention to all of this at the same time.
  - what is the end product supposed to look like?
  - I must apply this paint well 
  - how are the colors going to mix as I do?
  - how are my future ideas for this area of the painting going to be influenced by what I'm doing now (remember this is oil painting, so it's forever maleable and not very forgiving)

but like other crafts, the more you practice attending to all of this, the more some of it begins to flow.  You don't have to wory about your application style, it just is you.  It comes out without worrying about it.  You have developed a way to handle the way paint mixes when you apply it to earlier layers, and you use that now.  It's part of your work and you exploit it.  The more it flows the more you can attend to the real work. 

The whole intent of painting in the first place is to have the work express your intent.  A real developed craftsman can create beautiful art from a blank canvas.  They trust in their process, in the imediate mechanical moves.  
If the work is not developing to fit the vision then they have built it in a way that it's maleable, and correcitons can be made.
