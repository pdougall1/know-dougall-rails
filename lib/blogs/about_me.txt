Another attribute my history gives me is the empending knowledge that I don't really know.  So all the information here is a best approximation, with a "but I don't really know" looming in the background.  I consider this an asset however, because it means these understandings can evolve.  

Because of all of this, I'd really like feedback!  It's easy to read and absorb, praise, or even criticize peoples blog posts, but it's a little harder to work with them.  I consider these posts to be a part of the larger community and that means I have a responsability not to propogate bad conventions or anti-patterns.  However (as stated above), I don't necessarily know.  So lets make this more of a conversation and refignment.
