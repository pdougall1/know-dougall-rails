I want to have an outrageously comfy home for christmas, once I finally have a home.
I'm the kind of guy who's going to be waiting to finally start his lif with his real home one day, for his whole life.  I'm going to die alone without having ever started because I never wanted to settle.

I've never really found myself.  I've never found my cumfy place at home :)
