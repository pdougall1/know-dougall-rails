I was writing a small inhouse app recently and needed to pull out a bunch of code dealing with the Google API into a namespace, so naturally I wanted to slip it all into a module.  Trying to do this in a normal Ruby way was throwing all kinds of errors, not finding nested constants, being really weird.  

	show directory structure
	show code that didn't work
	show error

Eventually I found that Rails was messing with me. It was wrapping all the files in a subdirectory with a module named with the name of that direcory.  That sounds really confusing (as I found it) so let me show you for a sec.




describe how to use nested directory structure in rails

find Rails code that enforces this and explain it

is it good or bad?
do we use rails for the conventions?
is the anoyingness of rails because we don't like conventions messing with the way we write ruby or is it because we don't actually know the conventions?
